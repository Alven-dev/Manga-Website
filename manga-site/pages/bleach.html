                <h2>Story Summary</h2>
                    <p>Bleach follows Ichigo Kurosaki, a high school student who can see ghosts. One night, he encounters Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper (Shinigami) who protects the human world from evil spirits known as Hollows. When a powerful Hollow attacks his family, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo, making him a Substitute Soul Reaper.</p>
                    <p>As Ichigo learns to fight Hollows and help lost souls pass on, he becomes involved in a hidden supernatural world—the Soul Society, the afterlife realm governed by powerful Soul Reapers. When Rukia is arrested for giving her powers to a human, Ichigo and his friends embark on a daring rescue mission, leading to a clash with the Gotei 13, the ruling organization of Soul Reapers.</p>
                    <p>However, this is just the beginning. Ichigo soon faces greater threats:</p>
                    <ul class="artlist">
                        <li><span>Sōsuke Aizen</span>, a rogue Soul Reaper who betrays the Soul Society and seeks godlike power.</li>

                        <li><span>The Fullbringers</span>, humans with supernatural abilities linked to Hollows.</li>
                        <li><span>The Quincy Empire</span>, led by Yhwach, a god-like being who wages war against the Soul Society.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Through each battle, Ichigo uncovers shocking truths about his own heritage, his Zanpakutō (Zangetsu), and his deep connection to the war between Soul Reapers and Quincies. As he gains new powers—including Hollow abilities and Quincy origins—Ichigo fights to protect his friends, uphold his duty, and determine his own fate in the balance between life and death.</p>
