Both boys dream of becoming the Wizard King, the strongest mage in the kingdom. However, while Yuno is a magical prodigy, Asta is born without any magic at all, a rare phenomenon in their world.</p>
                <p>On the day they receive their grimoires, Yuno obtains a four-leaf clover grimoire, a sign of extraordinary talent, while Asta initially receives nothing. However, when Yuno is attacked by a thief, Asta awakens a mysterious five-leaf clover grimoire, containing the power of Anti-Magic, which nullifies spells. Armed with an enormous black sword, Asta defeats the enemy, proving that even without magic, he can fight against powerful opponents.</p>
                <p>Determined to achieve their dream, Asta and Yuno set out on their journeys, joining different Magic Knight squads:</p>
                <ul class="artlist">
                    <li>Yuno joins the elite Golden Dawn, the strongest squad in the Clover Kingdom.</li>
                    <li>Asta joins the infamous Black Bulls, a chaotic but powerful squad led by the unpredictable Captain Yami Sukehiro.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As they rise through the ranks, Asta and Yuno uncover dark secrets about their kingdom, battle powerful enemies like the Eye of the Midnight Sun and the Dark Triad, and learn the true history of magic, demons, and the Clover Kingdom itself. Asta, despite having no magic, continues to defy fate, proving that hard work, determination, and sheer willpower can rival even the strongest magic users.</p>
